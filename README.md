# BUBBLE-BASH-V2
A version 2 of the 2 day game jam game Bubble Bash created in January of 2025. This second version aims to improve the quality of the game itself and its experience with online multiplayer and even more party fun!

This version will include online multiplayer making use of Unreal Engine's built in multiplayer support with Steam. The game will be completely remade with C++ instead of blueprints to optimise the game for older hardware and to help learn C++ more.

With more mechanics, levels and fun to be had with this new version of the game, this repository will detail the development process of Bubble Bash's extended development from the original 2 day game jam that created it.
